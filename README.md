# Bullet Hell Game

This is my high school cs project, for the purpose of learning OOP inheritance. Developed with Turing language.
This is a [Bullet-hell/Danmaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up) game: player will control a plane, encounter enemies, and shoot'em up!

Enjoy the game with [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkBkVYw86HY)!
